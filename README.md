# Minium
[Current Release](https://my.moergo.com/go60/#/layout/user/ff2325fb-51e4-4998-88bd-937842589117)

Minium is a minimal fork of Sunaku's excellent [Glorious Engrammer](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) layout designed for the MoErgo Go60 and based around Enthium. This project is currently in development and modified in my spare time as I identify friction in my own usage. Currently this repo is intended as a landing page for the MoErgo Layout Editor release and to maintain the custom defined behaviors necessary to build there.

## Ongoing Development
I'm hoping to work to bring more of the required data into this repo to reduce reliance on the MoErgo editor for building, extend this readme to include my reasoning behind the deviations I made from GE, and include links to the ZSA Voyager variant of this layout soon.

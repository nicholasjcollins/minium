# Minium
[Current Release](https://my.moergo.com/go60/#/layout/user/ff2325fb-51e4-4998-88bd-937842589117)

Minium is a minimal fork of Sunaku's excellent [Glorious Engrammer](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps) layout designed for the MoErgo Go60 and based around Enthium. This project is currently in development and modified in my spare time as I identify friction in my own usage. You have two options for flashing this firmware (or your modifications of it). One is to "Clone to Edit" the Current Release above within the MoErgo editor, make your changes, and build through their tool. The other is to create your own repo with this as the baseline and build via GitHub actions. I aim to keep both versions up to date, but may need to retire / deviate the MoErgo version at some point if any changes are implemented in zmk that aren't supported by their editor 

## Ongoing Development
I'm hoping to work to extend this readme to include my reasoning behind the deviations I made from GE, and include links to the ZSA Voyager variant of this layout soon.
